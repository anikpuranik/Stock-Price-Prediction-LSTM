# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM
Predicting Correct Stock Price is very difficult and ambiguous task. Many Factors come into play while making predictions. Multiple research has done been in this direction and still not very concrete results has been obtained. However, with the use of Machine Learning significant improvement and pattern has been observed which has provided many good results.

Price prediction is a regression problem where data is continous and multiple Regression Algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN can be tried. But, as it is a Comtinous Time Series (next output depends on the previous output) we are using LSTM to implement Regression. LSTM has been found to outperform the traditional Machine Learning Algorithms.
